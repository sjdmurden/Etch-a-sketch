# etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-sketch created with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 


This is a fully working and interactive etch-a-sketch with black pen, random colour pen, and eraser. There is a slider that changes the amount of squares on the grid from a 10x10 to 50x50. It also features a "clear" button which clears the grid back to white.

JavaScript is used to dynamically create the canvas which is a square grid of <div>s. On loading the page, the grid starts at 20x20 and when the user adjusts the slider, the new slider value is the new grid dimension.
